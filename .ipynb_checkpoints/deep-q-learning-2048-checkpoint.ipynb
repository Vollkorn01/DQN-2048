    "# Deep Q Learning with the game 2048\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository trains a q deep learning network from the game 2048 and plots a performance graph. The gamelogic of the game 2048 is based on the implementation from Georg Wiese on his [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/georgwiese/2048-rl) and can for instance be played [here](http://2048game.com/de/). The deep q learning code is loosely based on the implementation form this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/keon/deep-q-learning) tutorial and was enhanced and adapted to include the game 2048.\n",

    "### The game 2048\n",
    "\n",
    "2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game developed by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. The game represents a 4 Ã— 4 grid where the value of each cell is a power of 2. An action can be any of the 4 movements: up, down, left right. When an action is performed, all cells move in the chosen direction. Any two adjacent cells with the same value (power of 2) along this direction merge to form one single cell with value equal to the sum of the two cells (i.e. the next power of 2). The objective of the game is to combine cells until reaching 2048. After each move, a new tile appears at a random empty cell. The game is finished until when all cells are full.\n",
    "TODO: Include example of 2048 move and explain difficulties\n",

    "#### Reward\n",
    "Normally in games, the reward directly relates to the score of the game. The goal of the game is to reach 2048 (although higher scores can be reached), so one option would be to play a game until the score 2048 is reached and then provide a reward. However, the chance to reach a score of 2048 using only random actions is very unlikely. Therefore we implemented rewards depending on the highest tile reached when the game is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss\n",
    "In order to logically represent this intuition and train it, we need to express this as a formula that we can optimize on. The loss is just a value that indicates how far our prediction is from the actual target. For example, the prediction of the model could indicate that it sees more value in swiping left when in fact it can gain more reward by swiping upwards. We want to decrease this gap between the prediction and the target (loss). The loss is defined as:\n",
    "TODO: include Loss formula.\n",
    "In our case this is calculated with this oneliner in the act funtion:\n",
    "\n",
    "target = (reward + self.gamma * np.amax(self.model.predict(next_state)[0]))\n",
