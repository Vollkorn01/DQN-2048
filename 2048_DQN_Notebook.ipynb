    "# Deep Q Learning with the game 2048\n",
    "Team Name: Deep Learners <br />\n",
    "GitHub Repo: https://github.com/Vollkorn01/DQN-2048\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository trains a q deep learning network from the game 2048 and plots a performance graph. The gamelogic of the game 2048 is based on the implementation from Georg Wiese on his [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/georgwiese/2048-rl) and can for instance be played [here](http://2048game.com/de/). The deep q learning code is loosely based on the implementation form this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/keon/deep-q-learning) tutorial and was greatly enhanced and adapted to include the game 2048.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "To start training, scroll down to the Cell called \"Train it\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### The game 2048\n",
    "\n",
    "2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game developed by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. The game represents a 4 × 4 grid where the value of each cell is a power of 2. An action can be any of the 4 movements: up, down, left right. When an action is performed, all cells move in the chosen direction. Any two adjacent cells with the same value (power of 2) along this direction merge to form one single cell with value equal to the sum of the two cells (i.e. the next power of 2). The objective of the game is to combine cells until reaching 2048. After each move, a new tile appears at a random empty cell. The game is finished/lost if all cells are full.\n",
    "To get a quick feeling of the game it is recommended to check out the free online version [here](http://2048game.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The game itself (gamelogic) of the game 2048 can be found in the folder gamelogic in file game.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies\n",
    "2048 is a game which starts easy but becomes very hard for human players. Obviously merging tiles whenever you can will get you to a certain level, but to reach a high score (or maximum value of e.g. 2048) there needs to be more sophisticated strategies. One of the most famous is to put the highest numbers in one corner (\"corner-strategy\"), like it is explained  [here](https://www.cnet.com/news/2048-starts-easy-gets-hard-heres-how-to-make-it-easy-again/). This technique also used by the most successfull 2048 AIs, for example [this one](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/04/27/artificial-intelligence-has-crushed-all-human-records-in-2048-heres-how-the-ai-pulled-it-off/) using an expectimax algorithm. \n",
    "The challenge of this game for AI is the high amount of possible states (more than 16^12) combined with the randomness introduced when spawning the new tiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reward\n",
    "We tried both the score and the maximum value of the tile as the reward value. The score is calculated in a way that it increases every time by the value of the newly merged tiles. If for example two 4s are merged the reward is 8.\n",
    "This means the score partly represents the highest value on the board but gives also an incentive to have multiple high value tiles compared to just looking at the maximum value present at the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our algorithm, we implemented both versions of the reward, which results in a optimization of the score or a win-lose classification with a fixed target respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the results below show, we achieved similar results with both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss\n",
    "In order to logically represent this intuition and train it, we need to express this as a formula that we can optimize on. The loss is just a value that indicates how far our prediction is from the actual target. For example, the prediction of the model could indicate that it sees more value in swiping left when in fact it can gain more reward by swiping upwards. We want to decrease this gap between the prediction and the target (loss). The loss is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = \\frac{1}{2} \\underbrace{\t[r + \\gamma*  max_{a'}Q(s',a')}_{\\mathrm{target}} -\\underbrace{Q(s,a)}_{\\mathrm{prediction}}]^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "whith the target q value looking like this in the code: <br>\n",
    "target = (reward + self.gamma * np.amax(self.model.predict(next_state)[0]))"

    "Next, we define the number of episodes to play and set the hyperparameters.<br>\n",
    "The parameters can be set in a seperate file called parameters.py.\n",
    "Every 100 episodes, key values are being saved in the folder data and can be plotted with the file plot.py.<br>\n",
    "We implemented an epsilon greedy algorithm with a decay. As you can see, the agent only explores in the beginning and starts decaying at a given rate epsilon_decay.<br>\n",

    "<b>gamma</b> = 0.001<br>\n",
    "In the case of taking the highest maximum value as the reward, gamma can be set to be very low or even to 0 because it is very hard to reach a reward.\n",
    "In the case of the score set as the reward where there are intermediate rewards, we found it to be better if gamma is not zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>epsilon_decay</b> = 0.99992 <br>\n",
    "Epsilon decay determines how fast epsilon decays.\n",
    "We found 0.99992 is an apropriate amount, because it reaches the min_epsilon=0.01 after 60'000 episodes and our computing power restricts us to max 100'000 episodes.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>learning_rate</b> = 0.01 <br>\n",
    "The learning_rate determines how fast gradient descent will find the solution. A too large learning rate will lead to overshooting and not finding the optimal solution.\n",
    "We had the best results with a standard learning_rate of 0.01, but there was no significant difference in the outcome if we changed it to 0.001.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>batch_size</b> = 32 <br>\n",
    "This determines the size of the batches used to replay and therefore to train the network.\n",
    "We found 32 to be used in most comparable problems. A batch size of 64 for instance would slow down training too much without any improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>is_max_value_reward </b>= True<br>\n",
    "This is the boolean value which can be set to either using the score (false) or the maximum value as a reward (true).<br>\n",
    "It can be seen below, both of the reward structures gave us similar results altough intuitively we expected the score to perform better as it gives more intermediate reward and there is no fixed threshold so we expected it to learn faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>max_value_reward_threshold</b> = 8<br>\n",
    "This parameter determines the threshold which number the agent has to reach to get the reward. \n",
    "If this is set to 8, the agent has to reach a 2^9=512 tile to get the reward.<br>\n",
    "As it takes a very long time to reach 2^10 but 2^9 is reached rather quickly those are the two configuratios we used. 2^9 (parameter of 8) performed much better then 2^10. We assume this is because 1024 is not reached enough times and because of the randomness of the game it is hard to replicate successful runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>max_value_reward_amount</b> = 1000<br>\n",
    "This is only used if is_max_value_reward = True and determines the reward which the agent gets when reaching the threshold. Because discount rate is very small and there are no other rewards, this parameter does not have a big influence on the result.\n",

The approximation of the Q-value converges to the true Q-value as we repeat the updating process. The loss will decrease and the score will go up."

    "## Results\n",
    "Below is the comparison of three different configurations which we found to be the most successful configurations and a random moving agent.<br>\n",
    "On the left side, each point on the plot reflects an average over 1000 games each. On the right side, each point reflects the maximum value in terms of score or the maximum tile over 1000 games each.\n",
    "(a) used a score based reward and (b) and (c) used maximum value-based rewards. <br>\n",
    "The difference between the latter two is that we set (c) up for a long training time and therefore set a higher threshold for the tile-value which it has to reach to get a reward (10 instead of 9). Note: a 9 would be a tile of value 2 to the power of 9 = 512 and the threshold has to be exceeded to get the reward, meaning if reward_threshold is 8, the agent has to reach a 10^9 to get the reward. <br>\n",
    "Overall we see a significant improvement in score and max_value compared to a random agent.<br> Our agent reached an average maxVal of 7.25 and an average score of 2200 after 60’000 episodes compared to an average maxVal of 6.58 and average score of 1050 of a random agent.<br>\n",
    "The comparison of lefthand side graphs (b) and (c) shows that there was no improvement in the averages if a higher threshold for the maximum value is chosen (2^10 instead of 2^9) and at the same time the number of episodes is drastically increased.<br>\n",
    "However on the right side we see that with more episodes, higher scores and max_values are reached in single games. <br>\n",
    "We think this shows that it is too unlikely to reach the defined reward threshold of 2^10 by random play and given the randomness in the game even harder to learn from those few occurences. <br>\n",
    "The highest tile we could reach was 2^10 which is 1024. Considering the exponential difficulty of the game, reaching 2048 would need a lot more training and optimization. <br>\n",
    "While looking at single games played from a trained agent, there is a clear trend that it uses left and up much more often then right or down. This would hint that the agent has learned a similar strategy to the \"corner-strategy\" mentioned above, because this strategy tends to put high values in the upper right corner."

    "### Playing the game\n",
    "During training, Keras saves a checkpoint of the model every 1000 episodes. When running the following cell, One game is played using the latest checkpoint, displaying the game grid after every move. <br>\n",
    "There is also the possiblily to load the agent (a) and (b) from the plots above to skip learning and use a trained agent right away. For this use one of agents file agent_a and agent_b included in the data folder and rename it to checkpoint, so it will automatically be used by play_single_game()."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "When we chose the game, we knew that it would be a hard one to play. Even for a human, there is no clear and obvious strategy in this game. <br>\n",
    "As expected the scores were not extremely high.\n",
    "Training speed was slower then expected (3.5min/1000-game-episode), which was also caused by the rather slow hardware we were using. <br>\n",
    "We also found that using a gpu did not increase the training speed, probably because of the low specs of the graphics card we used (gtx760 2GB) and the shallow network. <br>\n",
    "This made it difficult to test the many possible combinations of hyperparameters.\n",
    "Still our agent is consistently beating a random player and is reaching a 1028 tile in some games, which is already rather hard to do for an unexperienced player. <br>\n",
    "Furthermore it seems like the \"corner strategy\" is partly learned by the agent."
